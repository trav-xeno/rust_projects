# Rust projects
This repo will contian some basic rust projects along with Bevy 2D game as well.

## How to run the projects
Two ways! <br/>
1) <code>cargo run</code> if you download the whole the repo. <br/>
2) runing the binary or using the command <code>cargo build</code>  that I will add as I finish a project <br/>


## Reminders
This is just a list of remeinders that I will update so I can reference this and remember Rust quickly. <br/>
* Variables in Rust are immutable by default, and require the mut keyword to be made mutable <br/>
* int types there are two: u/i followed by {8,16,32,64} size. u pos only aka unsighed int i pos/neg aka signed <br/>
